# Document Up your Readmes!

Instantly beautify your Github repositories' `README.md` with DocumentUp. This site has been generated with it.

Essentially, it parses your readme's markdown into a clean and simple documentation website. Made especially for your `gh-pages` branch, all you need is a single `index.html` file that includes the DocumentUp script.*

\* Some configuration required

## Quick dress up

Simple as pie. Put that in your repository's gh-pages' branch's `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/documentup/latest.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      DocumentUp.document("username/repository");
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Make sure to change the `"username/repository"` to the repository's name and user's username.

## Usage

### Getting the script

**Recommended**  
Use [CDNJS](http://cdnjs.com) with this script `src`: `http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/documentup/latest.min.js`

**Also good**  
Download it from this repository There's a minified version of it named `documentup.min.js`

### Instantiation

DocumentUp, in its simplest form, accepts a single argument. A string representing a public repository's "route":

```javascript
DocumentUp.document("username/repository");
```

It can be enhanced with an option object like so:

```javascript
DocumentUp.document({
  repo:  "username/repository",
  color: "green"
});
```

### Options

**repo** (String) *required*  
Github repository in the form of `username/repository`

**name** (String) *default: repository name*  
Name of your project. It'll appear in the header of the sidebar. Defaults to the `repository` substring of the `repo` option.

**color** (String) *default: "#336699"*  
CSS-like color representing the color for the links both in the sidebar and the content.

**issues** (Boolean or String) *default: true*
Adds a link to the sidebar for the issues tab of the repository if `true`. Also accepts a string if your issues are managed elsewhere.

**travis** (Boolean) *default: false*  
Indicate if the project is being tested by [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org/). If `true`, it'll add the small travis badge in the sidebar.

**twitter** (String *or* Array of strings) *default: null*  
Add follow buttons for one or more Twitter accounts to your sidebar. Useful to gather followers.

## Formatting guide

Just like you normally would. DocumentUp also supports "Github Flavored Markdown" and we recommend you use it for syntax highlighting.

h1's (# in markdown) will appear as first level navigation in the sidebar while h2's (##) will appear under them as sub-navigation.

Example:

```plain
# Project name / Title (won't appear in the sidebar)

Some intro text if you want.

## Top level-navigation

### Sub-navigation

#### This wouldn't show up in the sidebar
```
