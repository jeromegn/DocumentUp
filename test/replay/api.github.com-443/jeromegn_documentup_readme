![DocumentUp](http://documentup.com/images/logo.png)

**This site has been generated with DocumentUp** (eat your own dog food, people)

Automatically generated documentation sites for your markdown files! There are various ways of getting your documentation going:

* [Hosted](#hosted)
* [On-Demand API](#on-demand-api)
* [gh-pages](#gh-pages)

## Hosted

DocumentUp hosts your documentation sites. Just visit `http://documentup.com/username/repository` to generate a site from your `README.md`.

Recommended if you have a public Github repository.

### Post-Receive Hook

If you want your readme to be recompiled, please add a [Post-Receive Hook](http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/) to your Github repository pointing to: `http://documentup.com/recompile`

*I'm still testing this feature. The URL shouldn't change though.*

Right now that's the only strategy, for the sake of simplicity.

### Manual Recompile

Visit `http://documentup.com/username/repository/recompile` to manually tell the server to recompile your readme.

Useful when changes are made to the stylesheets on the server but the compilation hasn't been triggered for a while.

### Configuration

Add a `.documentup.json` dotfile file to the root of your repository. Refer to the [options](#options) section below for its contents. Feel free to consult this repository's [`.documentup.json`](https://github.com/jeromegn/DocumentUp/blob/master/.documentup.json)

## On-Demand API

POST or JSONP called on `http://documentup.com/compiled`

Generates a standalone documentation HTML file.

Recommended for private Github repositories or local projects.

### Parameters

**content** (String) *required*
Markdown content you want converted

All the configuration parameters detailed [options](#options) are also valid.

### POST example

Pipe the response HTML into a file and open it. Example using `curl`:

```shell
curl -X POST --data-urlencode content@README.md \
http://documentup.com/compiled > index.html && open index.html
```

**Note:** If the file you're trying to pass contain ampersands, you need to manually change them to %26. Otherwise the URL will break.

### JSONP example with jQuery

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: "http://documentup.com/compiled",
  dataType: "jsonp",
  data: {
    content: "# test",
    name: "Test JSONP!"
  },
  success: function(resp){
    // `status` is always provided
    if (resp.status == 200) {
      // Write to your document
      document.open();
      document.write(resp.html);
      document.close();
    }
  }
});
```

## gh-pages

For those wanting to stay within the comfort of their gh-pages branch, it's still possible by using an `index.html` file similar to this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="documentup.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      DocumentUp.document("username/repository");
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Make sure to change the `"username/repository"` to the repository's name and user's username.

Use the `documentup.min.js` file in this repository, not the one what used to be on cdnjs.com, it's deprecated.

### Configuration

`DocumentUp.document` accepts either a String or an Object representing your desired configuration. If an object is used, remember to add a `repo` option containing the path `"username/repository"` to your github repository.

All options detailed in the [options](#options) section are available.

In addition to those, one special option is available to "gh-pages version" of DocumentUp:

**afterRender** (Function)
A function to be executed after the document has been replaced with the compiled HTML.

### Example

```javascript
DocumentUp.document({
  repo:  "jeromegn/documentup",
  name: "DocumentUp",
  twitter: [
    "jeromegn",
    "DocumentUp"
  ],
  afterRender: function(){
    alert("rendered");
  }
});
```

### What this script does

It does what's written in the JSONP section, without the jQuery dependency. It uses a endpoint like: `http://documentup.com/username/repository?callback=` to fetch the cached copy of the repository and then replaces the page's html with the generated documentation.

## Formatting guide

Just like you normally would. DocumentUp also supports "Github Flavored Markdown" and we recommend you use it for syntax highlighting.

It doesn't support tables as it is supported on Github, but you can use inline HTML.

h1's (# in markdown) will appear as first level navigation in the sidebar while h2's (##) will appear under them as sub-navigation.

Example:

```plain
# Project name / Title (won't appear in the sidebar)

Some intro text if you want.

## Top level-navigation

### Sub-navigation

#### This wouldn't show up in the sidebar
```

## Options

**name** (String) *default: repository name*
Name of your project. It'll appear in the header of the sidebar. Defaults to the `repository` substring of the `repo` option.

**color** (String) *default: "#336699"*
CSS-like color representing the color for the links both in the sidebar and the content.

**issues** (Boolean or String) *default: true*
Adds a link to the sidebar for the issues tab of the repository if `true`. Also accepts a string if your issues are managed elsewhere.

**travis** (Boolean) *default: false*
Indicate if the project is being tested by [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org/). If `true`, it'll add the small travis badge in the sidebar.

**twitter** (String *or* Array of strings) *default: null*
Add follow buttons for one or more Twitter accounts to your sidebar. Useful to gather followers.

**google_analytics** (String) *default: null*
This is your Google Analytics "UA" unique ID. Adds GA tracking to your generated documentation.
e.g.: "UA-5201171-14"
